# Quantiles-on-Hadamard-spaces
Code for the paper 'Quantiles on global non-positive curvature spaces'. 

Functions are contained in functions.py, the experiments on simulated data in simexperiments.py and the experiments on real data in realexperiments.py. For the real data experiments, the raw data are available at \url{https://github.com/facebookresearch/PoincareMaps/blob/main/datasets/Olsson.csv}, and the processed data in the Poincar\'e disk are available at \url{https://github.com/thupchnsky/PoincareLinearClassification/blob/main/embedding/olsson_poincare_embedding.npz}.
