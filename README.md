# Quantiles-on-Hadamard-spaces
Code for the paper 'Quantiles on global non-positive curvature spaces'. 

Functions are contained in functions.py, the experiments on the dispersion, skewness, kurtosis and spherical asymmetry measures in measureexperiments.py and the experiments on the transformation-retransformations procedure in trexperiments.py. For the real data experiments, the raw data are available at \url{https://github.com/facebookresearch/PoincareMaps/blob/main/datasets/Olsson.csv}, and the processed data in the Poincar\'e disk are available at \url{https://github.com/thupchnsky/PoincareLinearClassification/blob/main/embedding/olsson_poincare_embedding.npz}.
